# CyberpunkSaveEditor
A tool to edit Cyberpunk 2077 sav.dat files

# What works
1) load, save node tree
2) mini hexeditor for nodes data (can change node data size)
3) search tools (string, crc32 of string, u32, float double, from hexeditor clipboard)
4) [experimental] copy/paste skin blob between saves
    (this can fail for unknown reasons yet between fresh save and high-level save)

# Roadmap
1) Copy/Paste of character blobs between saves. DONE.
2) Some node-specific editor windows to replace the hex editor: inventory+itemData, appearance...
